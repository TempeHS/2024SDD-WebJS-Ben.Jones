//Puzzle idea container;
//Students use their HTML, CSS & JS skills to turn this into a word puzzle game. Think about the words 'once', 'three' and 'to' could be clicked in the correct order so as each is clicked it is styled differently to give player feedback, once all three words are clicked in the correct order the congratulations message is displayed.
